Version: v0.1

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and steps to create a modular, open-source library that integrates OpenTTS with TensorFlow TTS. The goal is to provide a seamless text-to-speech (TTS) experience by leveraging the capabilities of both OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS, while ensuring the library is easily reusable and extensible.

## Objectives

- Integrate TensorFlow TTS models into OpenTTS framework.
- Provide an easy-to-use API for selecting voices and generating speech.
- Ensure compatibility and extendibility for future TTS models.
- Create a modular architecture suitable for use in various projects.
- Distribute the library under the MIT license for broader adoption.

## Requirements

1. **Modular Architecture:**
   - Implement a plugin system for easy addition of new TTS engines.
   - Separate components for OpenTTS integration, TensorFlow TTS integration, and core API.

2. **TensorFlow TTS Setup:** 
   - Install TensorFlow TTS and configure models (e.g., Tacotron 2, MelGAN).

3. **OpenTTS Setup:** 
   - Install OpenTTS and configure it to integrate with TensorFlow TTS.

4. **Wrapper Classes:**
   - Create wrapper classes to interface TensorFlow TTS models with OpenTTS.

5. **Voice Selection:**
   - Implement functionality to select and switch between different voices.

6. **Configuration Management:**
   - Develop a flexible configuration system for easy setup and customization.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation including installation guide, API reference, and usage examples.

8. **Package Management:**
   - Prepare the module for distribution via PyPI.

9. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implement robust error handling and logging system.

10. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Implement caching and batch processing capabilities.

11. **Format Support:**
    - Support multiple audio output formats (WAV, MP3, OGG).

12. **Internationalization:**
    - Ensure support for multiple languages.

13. **Testing:**
    - Develop comprehensive tests including unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarks.

14. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

15. **Version Control and Releases:**
    - Implement semantic versioning and maintain a changelog.

16. **Security Considerations:**
    - Implement input sanitization and provide security usage guidelines.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Project Structure:**
   - Create a modular project structure with clear separation of concerns.
   - Set up version control (Git) and choose a license (MIT).

2. **Implement Core Functionality:**
   - Develop the core API for text-to-speech conversion.
   - Create wrapper classes for TensorFlow TTS models.
   - Implement voice selection functionality.

3. **Integrate with OpenTTS:**
   - Modify OpenTTS configuration to recognize and use the TensorFlow TTS wrappers.

4. **Develop Configuration System:**
   - Create a flexible configuration management system.

5. **Implement Additional Features:**
   - Add support for multiple audio formats.
   - Implement caching and batch processing.
   - Develop internationalization support.

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarks.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Write detailed documentation including API references, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

8. **Packaging and Distribution:**
   - Prepare the module for PyPI distribution.
   - Create necessary setup files and metadata.

9. **Community and Maintenance:**
   - Set up issue templates on GitHub.
   - Establish a process for version releases and changelog maintenance.

## Deliverables

1. Source code for the TTS integration library.
2. Comprehensive documentation (installation guide, API reference, usage examples).
3. Test suite including unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarks.
4. Configuration files for easy setup and customization.
5. Example scripts demonstrating various use cases.
6. PyPI package for easy installation.
7. GitHub repository with proper licensing, contribution guidelines, and issue templates.

## Success Criteria

1. The library successfully integrates OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS.
2. Users can easily select voices and generate speech using a simple API.
3. The module can be easily installed via pip and integrated into various projects.
4. Comprehensive documentation and examples are available.
5. The library passes all unit and integration tests.
6. The project is properly licensed and ready for open-source contribution.

## Future Considerations

1. Integration with additional TTS engines.
2. Development of a web-based demo interface.
3. Performance optimizations for large-scale TTS operations.
4. Support for real-time TTS in streaming applications.

This PRD will be regularly updated as the project progresses and new requirements or considerations arise.
