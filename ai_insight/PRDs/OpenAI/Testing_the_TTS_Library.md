# Testing the TTS Library

## Test Script

Write a standalone script to test core functions of your library, such as voice selection and TTS conversion.

Example:

```python
# test_script.py

from your_library import VoiceSelector, TTSConverter

def test_voice_selection():
    voice_selector = VoiceSelector()
    print("Available voices:", voice_selector.get_available_voices())
    selected_voice = voice_selector.select_voice("Voice1")
    print(selected_voice)

def test_tts_conversion():
    tts_converter = TTSConverter()
    text = "Hello, this is a test."
    audio = tts_converter.text_to_speech(text)
    print("Audio generated successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_voice_selection()
    test_tts_conversion()
```
## Unit Testing Frameworks

Use frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` to write unit tests for your library functions. These tests can be automated to ensure reliability.

Example:

```python
# test_library.py

import unittest
from your_library import VoiceSelector, TTSConverter

class TestVoiceSelector(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.voice_selector = VoiceSelector()

    def test_get_available_voices(self):
        voices = self.voice_selector.get_available_voices()
        self.assertIn("Voice1", voices)

    def test_select_voice(self):
        result = self.voice_selector.select_voice("Voice1")
        self.assertEqual(result, "Voice1 selected")

class TestTTSConverter(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.tts_converter = TTSConverter()

    def test_text_to_speech(self):
        text = "Hello, this is a test."
        audio = self.tts_converter.text_to_speech(text)
        self.assertIsNotNone(audio)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
## Mock Dependencies

Use mocking to simulate parts of the system that aren’t implemented yet. This allows you to test your library’s behavior in isolation.

## Integration Tests

Once core functions work, write integration tests to ensure different parts of your library work together. This includes testing the end-to-end workflow of converting text to speech and handling voice selection.
