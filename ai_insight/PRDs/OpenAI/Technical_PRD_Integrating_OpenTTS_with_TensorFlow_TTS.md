# Technical PRD: Integrating OpenTTS with TensorFlow TTS

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and steps to create a library that integrates OpenTTS with TensorFlow TTS. The goal is to provide a seamless text-to-speech (TTS) experience by leveraging the capabilities of both OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS.

## Objectives

- Integrate TensorFlow TTS models into OpenTTS framework.
- Provide an easy-to-use API for selecting voices and generating speech.
- Ensure compatibility and extendibility for future TTS models.

## Requirements

1. **TensorFlow TTS Setup:** 
   - Install TensorFlow TTS and configure models (e.g., Tacotron 2, MelGAN).

2. **OpenTTS Setup:** 
   - Install OpenTTS and configure it to integrate with TensorFlow TTS.

3. **Wrapper Classes:**
   - Create wrapper classes to interface TensorFlow TTS models with OpenTTS.

4. **Voice Selection:**
   - Implement functionality to select and switch between different voices.

5. **Testing:**
   - Develop comprehensive tests to validate functionality (see linked testing document).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure TensorFlow TTS and OpenTTS are installed.

2. **Create Wrapper Classes:**
   - Develop classes that wrap TensorFlow TTS models, making them compatible with OpenTTS API.

3. **Implement Voice Selection:**
   - Provide methods to list available voices and select a specific voice.

4. **Integrate with OpenTTS:**
   - Modify OpenTTS configuration to recognize and use the TensorFlow TTS wrappers.

5. **Testing:**
   - Write and run unit tests, integration tests, and mock tests to ensure the library works as expected.
