# OpenTTS TensorFlow Integration Project Progress Summary - v0.1

## Project Overview
We are developing a library that integrates OpenTTS with TensorFlow TTS to provide a seamless text-to-speech experience. The project aims to create a flexible, performant, and easy-to-use API for text-to-speech conversion.

## Completed Tasks

1. Set up the project structure and initialized Git repository.
2. Created the core module with:
   - `BaseTTS`: Abstract base class for TTS engines
   - `VoiceSelector`: Class to manage voice selection across different TTS engines
   - `PerformanceOptimizer`: Class for caching and batch processing
3. Implemented OpenTTS integration with `OpenTTSWrapper` class.
4. Implemented TensorFlow TTS integration with `TensorFlowTTSWrapper` class.
5. Created utility modules:
   - `ConfigManager`: For handling user settings and configurations
   - `AudioUtils`: For audio format conversion and processing
6. Updated requirements.txt with necessary dependencies.
7. Created initial documentation (README.md, documentation.md).

## Next Steps

1. Implement error handling and logging:
   - Set up a logging system
   - Implement try-except blocks for error handling
   - Create custom exceptions for specific error cases
2. Write unit tests for each major component.
3. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
4. Expand documentation with detailed API references and usage examples.
5. Implement internationalization support.
6. Create example scripts demonstrating various use cases.
7. Finalize open-source components (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.).
8. Perform final testing and bug fixes.
9. Prepare for first release (versioning, changelog, PyPI upload).

## Key Considerations

- Ensure compatibility between OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS components.
- Maintain flexibility for future additions of other TTS engines.
- Focus on performance optimization, especially for batch processing and caching.
- Provide clear documentation and examples for ease of use.
- Implement robust error handling and logging for better debugging and user experience.

This summary provides an overview of the project's current state and the planned next steps. It should serve as a useful reference point for resuming work efficiently if needed.
