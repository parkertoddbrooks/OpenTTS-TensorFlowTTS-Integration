# OpenTTS TensorFlow Integration Project Progress Summary - v0.6

Date: July 7, 2024

## Project Overview
We are developing a library that integrates OpenTTS with TensorFlow TTS to provide a seamless text-to-speech experience. The project aims to create a flexible, performant, and easy-to-use API for text-to-speech conversion with support for multiple engines and internationalization.

## Completed Tasks

1. Set up the project structure and initialized Git repository.
2. Implemented core functionality:
   - BaseTTS: Abstract base class for TTS engines
   - VoiceSelector: Class to manage voice selection across different TTS engines
   - PerformanceOptimizer: Class for caching and batch processing
3. Implemented OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS integrations.
4. Created utility modules for configuration, audio processing, and logging.
5. Implemented internationalization (i18n) support.
6. Created a comprehensive test suite covering all major components.
7. Updated documentation with detailed API references and usage examples.
8. Created example scripts demonstrating various use cases.
9. Set up issue templates on GitHub.
10. Added LICENSE file (MIT License).
11. Updated README with project description, features, and setup instructions.
12. Created and updated requirements.txt file.

## Recent Progress

1. Resolved issues with pytest-mock installation and usage.
2. Updated test files to properly mock dependencies:
   - Modified test_opentts_wrapper.py to correctly mock the 'opentts' import.
   - Addressed floating-point precision issues in test assertions.
3. Updated requirements.txt to include the correct version of TensorFlowTTS.

## Current Challenges

1. TensorFlow TTS Wrapper Issues:
   - The 'tensorflow_tts' module is not found in the tensorflow_tts_wrapper.py file.
   - TensorFlow TTS is not installed or not recognized in the current environment.

## Next Steps

1. Update test_tensorflow_tts_wrapper.py file:
   - Modify the file to correctly mock the 'tensorflow_tts' import.
   - Address any remaining issues with TensorFlow TTS installation or recognition.

2. Run comprehensive tests:
   - Execute the full test suite to ensure all components are working correctly.
   - Address any failing tests or unexpected behaviors.

3. Finalize documentation:
   - Ensure all recent changes are reflected in the documentation.
   - Update usage examples if necessary.

4. Prepare for the first release:
   - Implement semantic versioning.
   - Generate a changelog.
   - Set up PyPI package for easy installation.

5. Set up continuous integration (CI):
   - Configure GitHub Actions or another CI service for automated testing.

## Key Considerations

- Ensure compatibility between OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS components.
- Maintain flexibility for future additions of other TTS engines.
- Continue to focus on performance optimization, especially for batch processing and caching.
- Regularly update documentation and examples as new features are added.
- Implement robust error handling and logging for better debugging and user experience.

This summary provides an overview of the project's current state, recent progress in resolving testing issues, and the planned next steps. It serves as a useful reference point for resuming work efficiently and tracking project milestones.
