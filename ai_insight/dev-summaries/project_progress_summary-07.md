# OpenTTS TensorFlow Integration Project Progress Summary - v0.7

Date: July 7, 2024

## Project Overview
We are developing a library that integrates OpenTTS with TensorFlow TTS to provide a seamless text-to-speech experience. The project aims to create a flexible, performant, and easy-to-use API for text-to-speech conversion with support for multiple engines and internationalization.

## Completed Tasks

1. Set up the project structure and initialized Git repository.
2. Implemented core functionality:
   - BaseTTS: Abstract base class for TTS engines
   - VoiceSelector: Class to manage voice selection across different TTS engines
   - PerformanceOptimizer: Class for caching and batch processing
3. Implemented OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS integrations.
4. Created utility modules for configuration, audio processing, and logging.
5. Implemented internationalization (i18n) support.
6. Created a comprehensive test suite covering all major components.
7. Updated documentation with detailed API references and usage examples.
8. Created example scripts demonstrating various use cases.
9. Set up issue templates on GitHub.
10. Added LICENSE file (MIT License).
11. Updated README with project description, features, and setup instructions.
12. Created and updated requirements.txt file.
13. Resolved issues with pytest-mock installation and usage.
14. Updated test files to properly mock dependencies:
    - Modified test_opentts_wrapper.py to correctly mock the 'opentts' import.
    - Updated test_tensorflow_tts_wrapper.py to correctly mock 'tensorflow.saved_model.load'.
15. Addressed floating-point precision issues in test assertions.
16. Fixed all failing tests, resulting in a fully passing test suite.

## Recent Progress

1. Successfully resolved the failing test in test_tensorflow_tts_wrapper.py:
   - Implemented proper mocking for 'tensorflow.saved_model.load'.
   - Updated assertions in test functions to correctly verify mocked function calls.
2. Achieved a fully passing test suite with 40 passing tests.
3. Improved overall test robustness and reliability.

## Current Challenges

1. There are some DeprecationWarnings related to Google's protocol buffers library, which are not critical for the project's functionality but may need to be addressed in the future.

## Next Steps

1. Review and update all project documentation to reflect the latest changes and current project state.
2. Consider implementing additional features or improvements based on the project roadmap.
3. Explore options for addressing the DeprecationWarnings related to Google's protocol buffers library.

## Key Considerations

- Maintain the current level of test coverage and continue to improve test robustness.
- Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and accurately reflects the project's current state.
- Continue to focus on maintaining compatibility between OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS components.
- Keep the project structure flexible for potential future additions of other TTS engines.

This summary provides an overview of the project's current state, recent progress in resolving testing issues, and the immediate next steps. It serves as a useful reference point for tracking project milestones and guiding future development efforts.
