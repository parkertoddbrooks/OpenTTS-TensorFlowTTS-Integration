# OpenTTS TensorFlow Integration Project Progress Summary - v0.2

## Project Overview
We are developing a library that integrates OpenTTS with TensorFlow TTS to provide a seamless text-to-speech experience. The project aims to create a flexible, performant, and easy-to-use API for text-to-speech conversion.

## Completed Tasks

1. Set up the project structure and initialized Git repository.
2. Created the core module with:
   - `BaseTTS`: Abstract base class for TTS engines
   - `VoiceSelector`: Class to manage voice selection across different TTS engines
   - `PerformanceOptimizer`: Class for caching and batch processing
3. Implemented OpenTTS integration with `OpenTTSWrapper` class.
4. Implemented TensorFlow TTS integration with `TensorFlowTTSWrapper` class.
5. Created utility modules:
   - `ConfigManager`: For handling user settings and configurations
   - `AudioUtils`: For audio format conversion and processing
   - `logging_utils`: For error handling and logging
6. Updated requirements.txt with necessary dependencies.
7. Created initial documentation (README.md, documentation.md).
8. Implemented error handling and logging throughout the project.
9. Created a comprehensive test suite covering all major components:
   - BaseTTS
   - OpenTTSWrapper
   - TensorFlowTTSWrapper
   - VoiceSelector
   - PerformanceOptimizer
10. Updated documentation to include information about running tests.

## Next Steps

1. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions or another CI service.
2. Expand documentation with detailed API references and usage examples.
3. Implement internationalization support.
4. Create example scripts demonstrating various use cases.
5. Finalize open-source components (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.).
6. Perform final testing and bug fixes.
7. Prepare for first release (versioning, changelog, PyPI upload).

## Key Considerations

- Ensure compatibility between OpenTTS and TensorFlow TTS components.
- Maintain flexibility for future additions of other TTS engines.
- Focus on performance optimization, especially for batch processing and caching.
- Provide clear documentation and examples for ease of use.
- Implement robust error handling and logging for better debugging and user experience.
- Regularly run and update tests as new features are added or existing ones are modified.

This summary provides an overview of the project's current state, recent progress in implementing a comprehensive test suite, and the planned next steps. It serves as a useful reference point for resuming work efficiently and tracking project milestones.
