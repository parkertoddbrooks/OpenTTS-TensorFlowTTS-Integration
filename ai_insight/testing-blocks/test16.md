This is where we are:

1. Update README:
   - Remove the PyPI installation instructions.
   - Add a clear "Development Status" section at the top.
   - Provide instructions for cloning the repository and setting up a development environment.

2. Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file:
   - Outline how others can contribute to the project.

3. Update the "Quick Start" section:
   - Show how to use the project directly from the cloned repository.

4. Consider adding a "Roadmap" section:
   - Outline your plans for UI development and future features.

Let's do each line a step at a time. And skip 2. and 4. 

Also, I added: 

## Development Status

let's continue one item at a time.
