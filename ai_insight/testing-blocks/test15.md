We are working on a project together. 

Here is the last available status summary: 
/Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/OpenTTS_TensorFlow_Integration/ai_insight/dev-summaries/project_progress_summary-08.md

This is the last part of the conversation before I ran in API issues - it a log from the CLI: 
/Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/OpenTTS_TensorFlow_Integration/ai_insight/dev-summaries/files_for_git_ignore/cli-dump-03-last-steps.md

And we are now as the last part. And I want to give you instruction on what to add to the .gitignore file before we move on to commit. 

Can you review these files, and ask any questions before we proceed?
